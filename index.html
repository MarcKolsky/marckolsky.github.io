        <h2>My Work</h2>

<p>I have been programming with C# for the last two years, and am presenting a small coding sample from three of my favorite projects I have worked on to date. Sections of the code have been omitted for this sample, but full scripts will be made available upon request during an interview.</p>

      <h2>Phase 10 Scorecard</h2>

      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>I originally created this application for my mother as a birthday present in the first half of 2014. Phase 10 is a card game where keeping score is the most laborious and unfavorable part of the game. Unhappy with available Phase 10 scorecards in iTunes, I decided to build an application that my mother could use on her Samsung tablet, and simplify the score keeping when we played Phase 10.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Scoring consists of simply dragging a value from a listbox, and dropping it on the player's score box. The totaling of the score is done in the background automatically, and displayed at the bottom of each player's score box.</li>
        <li>Keeping track of which player's complete a level can be laborious at times, so I programmed in the functionality to automatically track which level a player is on based on points. If a player has &lt;= 45 points at the end of a round, that player's level tracker increases by one. If a player has &gt;= 50 points at the end of a round, then they will remain on the same level as before. This greatly simplifies the process.</li>
        <li>If a mistake has been made while inputing the scores at the end of a round, this application has a button for that. The application tracks every score inputed, and will undo each input one by one until the mistake is corrected. Every score and level will be updated with every click of the undo button.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>FTP Program</h2>
      <ul>

      </ul>

<h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>In response to the need for an FTP service to send large files to clients, this was my first opportunity to build a C# business application. My first FTP program was built in February 2013, but was able to do a complete overhaul in May 2014. Listening to the user's of the application led to many of the changes made. This application simplies the process of sending large files through email. The simplicity of this application makes it popular among its users.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>I added in an extra large listbox that allows users to drag and drop multiple files at a time into the application. This simplies the process, and elliminates the need to go through an explorer to find your files. You can also add in entire folders if needed. Every file dropped into this listbox will be added to a Zip file before being uploaded to the server to keep customers from having to download more than one file, and reducing the overal size of the upload/download using Zip's built-in compression.</li>
        <li>All files are uploaded to an Amazon S3 server, utilizing Amazon's SDK. Several checks are built-in to this application to make sure no file is overwirtten, unless authorized by the user, and organizes the files by client to keep the file structure nice and neat.</li>
        <li>Once the Zip file is uploaded to the Amazon S3 server, the application creates a new email in Outlook that contains a link for the customer to click and download the Zip file from the Amazon server. The entire process is minimized to create the least amount of work with the greatest amount of benefit for the user.</li>
      </ol>
