        <h2>My Work</h2>

<p>I have been programming with C# for the last two years, and am presenting a small coding sample from three of my favorite projects I have worked on to date. Sections of the code have been omitted for this sample, but full scripts will be made available upon request during an interview.</p>

      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>I originally created this application for my mother as a birthday present in the first half of 2014. Phase 10 is a card game where keeping score is the most laborious and unfavorable part of the game. Unhappy with available Phase 10 scorecards in iTunes, I decided to build an application that my mother could use on her Samsung tablet, and simplify the score keeping when we played Phase 10.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Scoring consists of simply dragging a value from a list box, and dropping it on the player's score box. The totaling of the score is done in the background automatically, and displayed at the bottom of each player's score box.</li>
        <li>Keeping track of which player's complete a level can be laborious at times, so I programmed in the functionality to automatically track which level a player is on based on points. If a player has &lt;= 45 points at the end of a round, that player's level tracker increases by one. If a player has &gt;= 50 points at the end of a round, then they will remain on the same level as before. This greatly simplifies the process.</li>
        <li>If a mistake has been made while inputing the scores at the end of a round, this application has a button for that. The application tracks every score inputed, and will undo each input one by one until the mistake is corrected. Every score and level will be updated with every click of the undo button.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>FTP Program</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>In response to the need for an FTP service to send large files to clients, this was my first opportunity to build a C# business application. My first FTP program was built in February 2013, but was able to do a complete overhaul in May 2014. Listening to the user's of the application led to many of the changes made. This application simplifies the process of sending large files through email. The simplicity of this application makes it popular among its users.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>I added in an extra large list box that allows users to drag and drop multiple files at a time into the application. This simplifies the process, and eliminates the need to go through an explorer to find your files. You can also add in entire folders if needed. Every file dropped into this list box will be added to a Zip file before being uploaded to the server to keep customers from having to download more than one file, and reducing the overall size of the upload/download using Zip's built-in compression.</li>
        <li>All files are uploaded to an Amazon S3 server, utilizing Amazon's SDK. Several checks are built-in to this application to make sure no file is overwritten, unless authorized by the user, and organizes the files by client to keep the file structure nice and neat.</li>
        <li>Once the Zip file is uploaded to the Amazon S3 server, the application creates a new email in Outlook that contains a link for the customer to click and download the Zip file from the Amazon server. The entire process is minimized to create the least amount of work with the greatest amount of benefit for the user.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Active Directory Interface</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>At the request of the Network Administrator at EWI, I was tasked with creating an application that would allow HR to add, edit, and delete employees' profiles in Active Directory. Any IT professional will tell you that giving HR access to Active Directory is a bad idea. This application challenged me to find a way to interface with Active Directory without giving administrative privileges to it's users. The simplicity of this application gives a false impression to the true complexity hiding behind the scenes. This application gives HR the freedom to add/edit/remove employees as needed without getting the IT department involved, but safe guards Active Directory from unauthorized access. From a design standpoint, I was inspired by the tiling of a Windows 8 application and had a little fun with it.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To create a new employee profile in Active Directory, the application asks for some basic information from the user (First name, last name, job title, department, etc.). After entering in the required information, the application connects to the server with admin credentials, and then connects to Active Directory. This secure connection operates behind the scenes, and does not give the user any control of Active Directory outside what it's programmed to do. Once a new profile has been created and populated with the information provided by the user, it activates the profile and sets the initial password, and adds the new employee to the appropriate user groups. Then the application connects to the Exchange Server and sets up the new employee's email mailbox using Exchange Powershell. The new employee has been added, and is ready to go.</li>
        <li>If an employee's profile needs to be edited, I have made this a simple operation. Most commonly, when an employee gets married or divorced, their Active Directory profile and Exchange mailbox has to be changed. I have made this an automated process, leaving nothing to get frustrated about. When an employee's name changes, their username is updated, their Exchange mailbox creates a new alias while retain the old aliases, and their user folder (My Documents) on the file server is changed to reflect their new name.</li>
        <li>My favorite part of this application is something never asked for, but I saw the need for it. When an employee is let go, all access to the company's system needs to be revoked. With this application, the process is completed in 3 simple steps. One, the user selects the employee being let go from a combo box. Two, the user selects the employee/manager with whom the email should be redirected too. And three, clicks the disable button. From here the application disables the employees account, resets the password, removes the employee from subscribed user groups in Active Directory. Then the application connects to the Exchange server and redirects the employees email to the selected recipient, and removes all mailbox privileges so they cannot access email from their phone or on the web. Finally, to protect against unauthorized access by the former employee to his/her computer, the application searches the network to find out which computer the employee is logged into and sends it into hibernation. The computer can then be awaken at a later time by the IT department, logged into with the employee's reset password, and everything will be as it was when put into hibernation.</li>
