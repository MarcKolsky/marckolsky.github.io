        <h2>My Work</h2>

<p>I have been programming with C# for 5 years, and am presenting a small coding sample of projects I have worked on. Sections of the code have been omitted for security reason.  Newer code sample could be provided during an interview, but contain too much company informationto publish here on Github.</p>

      <h2>Custom Weather Widget User Control</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="single"><a href="https://github.com/MarcKolsky/Weather-Widget">View Code On <strong>GitHub</strong></a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>Frustrated with the lack of customizations for existing weather forecast widgets, I built my own widget with a user control in C#.  Utilizing a web api from Open Weather, I built a user interface to visually display the current weather and 5-day forecast and coded it update the weather on a timed interval.  This user control can used in  a WPF project as I used it as part of a check in display for guests as they checked in at a resort.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Large background that changes with the trype of weather currently being experience (i.e. Sunny, Cloudy, Raining, Thunderstorms, etc.)</li>
        <li>This code alows for easy changing of location in the web api call.  Built for reusability!</li>
        <li>Logs issues into a simple text file making it easy to detect and resolve issues.</li>

<h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>In response to the need for an FTP service to send large files to clients, this was my first opportunity to build a C# business application. My first FTP program was built in February 2013, but was able to do a complete overhaul in May 2014. Listening to the user's of the application led to many of the changes made. This application simplifies the process of sending large files through email. The simplicity of this application makes it popular among its users.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>I added in an extra large list box that allows users to drag and drop multiple files at a time into the application. This simplifies the process, and eliminates the need to go through an explorer to find your files. You can also add in entire folders if needed. Every file dropped into this list box will be added to a Zip file before being uploaded to the server to keep customers from having to download more than one file, and reducing the overall size of the upload/download using Zip's built-in compression.</li>
        <li>All files are uploaded to an Amazon S3 server, utilizing Amazon's SDK. Several checks are built-in to this application to make sure no file is overwritten, unless authorized by the user, and organizes the files by client to keep the file structure nice and neat.</li>
        <li>Once the Zip file is uploaded to the Amazon S3 server, the application creates a new email in Outlook that contains a link for the customer to click and download the Zip file from the Amazon server. The entire process is minimized to create the least amount of work with the greatest amount of benefit for the user.</li>
      </ol>

<h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>At the request of the Network Administrator at EWI, I was tasked with creating an application that would allow HR to add, edit, and delete employees' profiles in Active Directory. Any IT professional will tell you that giving HR access to Active Directory is a bad idea. This application challenged me to find a way to interface with Active Directory without giving administrative privileges to it's users. The simplicity of this application gives a false impression to the true complexity hiding behind the scenes. This application gives HR the freedom to add/edit/remove employees as needed without getting the IT department involved, but safe guards Active Directory from unauthorized access. From a design standpoint, I was inspired by the tiling of a Windows 8 application and had a little fun with it.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To create a new employee profile in Active Directory, the application asks for some basic information from the user (First name, last name, job title, department, etc.). After entering in the required information, the application connects to the server with admin credentials, and then connects to Active Directory. This secure connection operates behind the scenes, and does not give the user any control of Active Directory outside what it's programmed to do. Once a new profile has been created and populated with the information provided by the user, it activates the profile and sets the initial password, and adds the new employee to the appropriate user groups. Then the application connects to the Exchange Server and sets up the new employee's email mailbox using Exchange Powershell. The new employee has been added, and is ready to go.</li>
        <li>If an employee's profile needs to be edited, I have made this a simple operation. Most commonly, when an employee gets married or divorced, their Active Directory profile and Exchange mailbox has to be changed. I have made this an automated process, leaving nothing to get frustrated about. When an employee's name changes, their username is updated, their Exchange mailbox creates a new alias while retain the old aliases, and their user folder (My Documents) on the file server is changed to reflect their new name.</li>
        <li>My favorite part of this application is something never asked for, but I saw the need for it. When an employee is let go, all access to the company's system needs to be revoked. With this application, the process is completed in 3 simple steps. One, the user selects the employee being let go from a combo box. Two, the user selects the employee/manager with whom the email should be redirected too. And three, clicks the disable button. From here the application disables the employees account, resets the password, removes the employee from subscribed user groups in Active Directory. Then the application connects to the Exchange server and redirects the employees email to the selected recipient, and removes all mailbox privileges so they cannot access email from their phone or on the web. Finally, to protect against unauthorized access by the former employee to his/her computer, the application searches the network to find out which computer the employee is logged into and sends it into hibernation. The computer can then be awaken at a later time by the IT department, logged into with the employee's reset password, and everything will be as it was when put into hibernation.</li>
